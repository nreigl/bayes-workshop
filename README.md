Thank you for your registration to the Bayesian statistics workshop.    

We start at 10 AM each morning and finish roughly at 17:45 PM.   

Location: Akadeemia tee 3, rooms SOC-413 (Oct 2, 3, 17) and SOC-418 (Oct 16). The rooms should be easy to find.    

Bring your laptop. We will use RStudio Cloud for the hands-on sessions, so there is no need to install any software beforehand. However, as RStudio Cloud runs in your browser it can sometimes be slow. So, if you wish, you can download R (https://www.r-project.org/), RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), and Stan (https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan) into your laptop. But if you have any problems with installations, then don’t worry – you can use RStudio Cloud.    

Coffee breaks and lunches will be provided.   

Don’t forget to bring your digital COVID certificate or a recent negative test.
